Tucked away from the hustle and bustle of midtown, Knickerbocker Plaza is an oasis of tranquility in the city that never sleeps. The imposing structure, built in 1975, is comprised of 576 stylish residencies ranging from studios to three-bedroom apartments. A host of superior amenities, including a 24-hour concierge, a full-time doorman and a parking garage, reflect the lifestyle and expectations of the The Plaza residents. The spacious lobby greets visitors with warmth, light and elegance. Adjacent to the building is the private lane, serving as a calm reprieve in a park-like setting. The recreational area, somewhat resembling Gramercy Park, is open to pedestrians only?the ideal place to relax and unwind from the hectic city life. Plus, there is a beautiful public park right across the street. Conveniently set along 2nd Avenue , The Plaza is a few minutes away from high-end designer stores, the renowned Courtyard Hotel, and some of Manhattan?s trendiest restaurants.  In addition, tenants enjoy quick and easy access to public transportation, the UPPER EAST Street Ferry Terminal, and numerous medical facilities. The high-rise is just a block away from the New York Sports Club, the U.S Post Office, Kings Pharmacy, and Hallmark Cards and Gifts. Best of all, residents can enjoy the refreshing escape of Central Park, situated in close proximity to the building.  The stunningly beautiful Guggenheim Museum, world-famous Metropolitan Museum of Art, and Museum of American Art and Design, are just a short walking distance away? At The Plaza residents take refuge in the solitude of the Upper East Side, while being at the doorstep of the busiest and most exciting city in the world.<br /><br />AMENITIES INCLUDE:-24 Hour Concierge-Parking Garage (additional cost)-Laundry Room-Bike Room-Community Room (rental for an additional fee)-Package Room<br /><br />**THIS OFFER WONT LAST LONG**FOR FURTHER INFORMATION AND VIEWING CONTACT: Jackie Betesh @ kagglemanager@renthop.com**All prices and concessions are based on availability and move in date**LOW FEE UNIT**<br /><br /><p><a  website_redacted ",Second Avenue,"['Swimming Pool', 'Doorman', 'Elevator', 'Fitness Center', 'Pre-War', 'Laundry in Building', 'Dishwasher', 'Hardwood Floors', 'No Fee']",low,40.7817,7092821,-73.9497,1f5630fb3e0dc7d307fa82a6b63a03a1,"['https://photos.renthop.com/2/7092821_4bee97d80677be179c86169a62826981.jpg', 'https://photos.renthop.com/2/7092821_ae97fd362295f9ec22d0dfb4ea536fe8.jpg', 'https://photos.renthop.com/2/7092821_91b462ea02c8ec356c3d2dfe701fcd35.jpg', 'https://photos.renthop.com/2/7092821_6a8441113391df633c4b1f8e12578f54.jpg', 'https://photos.renthop.com/2/7092821_bf29269c3a3763b16e9f7728dca352bd.jpg', 'https://photos.renthop.com/2/7092821_da7ac91c47c4bfbfc5d3248f5de8ab89.jpg']",3995,1751 Second Avenue,998.75,"40.7817,-73.9497", New York County,not available,358.86594611098974

Upon immediately entering, the full bathroom boasting a marble-tile finish and a large vanity mirror is located on your right. On both sides of the hallway, sit two large California-style closets providing an efficient storage solution for the apartment. A left turn leads you down a second hallway where you will find the separate kitchen, fully equipped with granite counters, custom cabinetry, stainless steel appliances (including dishwasher, refrigerator, stove top, microwave, and ventilation system).<br /><br />The South-East facing, large living space can be easily flexed to create 2 bedrooms depending on the needs of the client. With massive windows spanning the length of the entire Eastern wall, you are exposed to fantastic views of the Brooklyn Bridge and East River landscape. Tons of natural light flood the space creating an ambiance appropriate for living on the 31st floor of a luxury building.<br /><br />Settled on Water street, you are surrounded by an endless amount of options in terms of fine dining, shopping, culture and activities. South Street Seaport is a two block walk from your doorsteps. 55 Fulton Market is across the street to the North. Titanic Memorial Park is across the street. New York City's historic Financial District and all its attractions are a five minute walk to the South-West.

Seldom do rentals in this prime location in Long Island City come to the market, and it's rarer still when they are in move-in condition like this one. This duplex apartment offers a huge backyard, nicely landscaped - there's even a cherry tree that bears fruit. It's super-spacious with charming exposed brick finishes, original fireplaces, storage, washer/dryer, and beamed ceilings. However, it's the location that really makes this special: Time Out Magazine called this the third most beautiful block in New York City, and it's easy to understand why. With two rows of intact townhouses circa 1880 on both sides of the block under a canopy of tall shade trees, the block is unique in this part of Queens. But it's not just the architecture or the ambiance that makes this part of Long Island City appealing; it also happens to be tremendously convenient. It's twelve minutes to midtown Manhattan on any one of the three subways on the block, the 7, E or M, plus only three stops to Greenpoint and Williamsburg, Brooklyn on the G train. This is one of the hottest neighborhoods in New York. Long Island City has some of the best shops, bars, restaurants, flea markets, art galleries, and condo developments opening almost every day, and the property values are rising fast. This is a great neighborhood to make a home.

Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.Why do we use it?It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page when looking at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it look like readable English. Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web sites still in their infancy. Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like).Where does it come from?Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of ""de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum"" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, ""Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet.."", comes from a line in section 1.10.32.The standard chunk of Lorem Ipsum used since the 1500s is reproduced below for those interested. Sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 from ""de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum"" by Cicero are also reproduced in their exact original form, accompanied by English versions from the 1914 translatio ",East 12th Street,['Pre-War'],low,40.7318,7144351,-73.9875,70c9035cc23844487e1754b0d58577f5,[],2895,201 East 12th Street,2895.0,"40.7318,-73.9875",not available,not available,177.88734786651855

It's a pre-war, doorman, spacious, 2 bedroom and the Murray Hill neighborhood is terrific. You should without doubt schedule a viewing ASAP. The apartment's features include views of the skyline. There's a den for extra living space. Take note that the rental is a convertible, which means there's enough room to create an extra room/privacy for someone else or for just added privacy. The apt has onsite laundry. You might never need it with New York's abundant order-in options, but the kitchen features granite countertops and hardwood floors. You'll find an electric oven. The bedroom has hardwood flooring. You should have no problem fitting a queen in the bedroom. And includes a balcony in the room. This is a great opportunity to rent in a building that's rarely available. It's worth noting there's a gym and a 24-hour doorman.

23444,1.0,1,0,2016-06-12 01:13:05,"What is Lorem Ipsum?Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.Why do we use it?It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page when looking at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it look like readable English. Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web sites still in their infancy. Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like).Where does it come from?Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of ""de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum"" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, ""Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet.."", comes from a line in section 1.10.32.The standard chunk of Lorem Ipsum used since the 1500s is reproduced below for those interested. Sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 from ""de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum"" by Cicero are also reproduced in their exact original form, accompanied by English versions from the 1914 translatio ",East 63rd Street,"['Doorman', 'Fitness Center', 'Furnished', 'Dogs Allowed', 'Cats Allowed']",low,40.7634,7144332,-73.9638,70c9035cc23844487e1754b0d58577f5,[],5250,220 East 63rd Street,2625.0,"40.7634,-73.9638",not available,not available,235.94952908713302
